This project demonstrates the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST dataset in Julia. The CNN model is designed and trained using the Flux library, with a focus on computing classification accuracy and detailed metrics such as recall, precision, specificity, and F1 score for each class
